# QUADRATIC-EQUATIONS
Quadratic equations are the polynomial equation with degree 2. It is represented as ax2 + bx +c = 0, where a, b and c are the coefficient variable of the equation. The universal rule of quadratic equation defines that the value of 'a' cannot be zero, and the value of x is used to find the roots of the quadratic equation (a, b). A quadratic equation's roots are defined in three ways: real and distinct, real and equal, and real and imaginary.

The nature of the roots depends on the Discriminant (D) where D is.

If D > 0, the roots are real and distinct (unequal)
If D = 0, the roots are real and equal.
If D < 0, the roots are real and imaginary.
